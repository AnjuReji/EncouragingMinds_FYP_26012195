# Encouraging Minds Application 
BSc Computer Science Final Year Disseration Project (26012195)

This project is aimed at individuals with Autism to help them learn and understand emotions demonstrated on a human face. Due to this, the Encourahing Minds Application was produced to provide a fun and interactive learning environment for the users. This includes a quizzes to identify which emotions are being displays split into three levels of beginner, intermediate and difficult. This allows users to work up on their comfortablility and unlock levels as they progress. 

A fourth section was included in the Android application which was supposed to perform recognition of facial emotions on an image. With emotions including happy, sad, angry, neutral, disgust, surprise and fear. However, it is only able to scan the image as the ML Kit package and Microsoft Emotion API has either depreacted or no longer exists so it was difficult to make this possible on this occasion.
